### Problem Statement
In India, COPD(Chronic Pulmonary Disease) is the second-highest cause of death after heart disease in 2017, killing 1 million Indians that year, according to the University of Washington's Global Burden of Disease study, 2018. COPD led to 13% of all deaths in India, and 7.5 million were at the risk of the disease in 2016.Existing solutions in terms of detections are essentially observation-based, where doctors observe x-rays and use their judgment to diagnose the disease. 

### Solution
Amateur doctors and misdiagnosis are the leading cause of deaths in India. Deep-learning models can solve this problem with higher accuracy and speed, cost-effectively
